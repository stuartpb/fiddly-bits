Replacements for small parts of things, little odds and ends that aren't important enough to warrant individual model numbers

This is a piece for a [Cuisinart DCC-450][] coffee maker that connects the Reservoir Cover to the Showerhead. The one in my coffee maker broke at the shoulder of the axle that connects to the Showerhead: I've super-glued it together a few times now, but it still breaks sometimes.

It's not important enough to warrant its own piece number or name in the manual: I only know it by the letter "B" that has been stamped on its top surface.

I've thought about 3D-printing a replacement; if I did so, I would want to do it in black nylon, which would match the color of the original part, be chemically food-safe, and heat-resistant enough to withstand the steamy interior of the coffee maker.
